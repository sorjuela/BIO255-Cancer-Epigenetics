# BIO255-Cancer Epigenetics: Marra lab practical

Here is the material for the practical session of [BIO255](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/index.html#/details/2018/003/SM/50712158) in the Marra lab.

In this practical you will learn about:

1. Principle of bisulfite modification of cytosine.
2. How to treat DNA with bisulfite; how to amplify and then clone bisulfite-treated DNA.
3. How to map cytosine methylation on a genomic region after sequencing of cloned DNA.
4. Basics in R and how to annotate genomic regions.

## Schedule for the week is as follows:

|Time|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|
|-------------|---|---|---|---|
|9:00 - 12:00||Lab session: Y17 K-32|Self-study: Report and presentation preparation, and bioinfo exercise| Lab session: Y17 K-32|
|12:01 - 13:00||Lunch break (time could change)||Lunch break (time could change)|
|13:01 - 14:30|Bioinfo session 1: R basics|Lab session||Lab session|
|14:31 - 15:00|Coffee break|Lab session||Lab session|
|15:01 - 16:00|Bioinfo session 2: Genomic Ranges|Lab session (could extend)|Lab session: Y17 K-32|Lab session (could extend)|

* For Tuesday you must bring a laptop with RStudio installed, preferibly with R and all packages up to date (`ggplot2`, `GenomicRanges`, `annotatr`).
* You should spend Thursday solving the exercise from Tuesday, and preparing a report due on the following **Monday**. The report should include a description of the week activities along with results. It should also include the findings from the bioinfo exercise (DMR annotation), and a description of the gene evaluated. Why/how do you think hypermethylation in this gene could promote tumorigensis? feel free to search the web for references to support your arguments. 
* The report can be structured with: Small introduction, aims, methods, results, discussion. Maximum 3 pages in pdf format.

## Information about evaluation:
* The final grade will be calculated according to practical work (1/3), the written exam (1/3) and the presentation (1/3). 
* *Written exam*: Tuesday 27.11 from 14:00-16:00, Location Y11E05
* *Oral exam*: Wednesday 28.11 from 8:30-13:00, Location Y11E05
  * Group E: 11:45-12:25 
  * Group F: 12:30-13:00 
* Each group will present a 12 minutes presentation showing the work done in both practicals (each student will present one of the practicals, the students decide how to distribute the presentations). This will be followed by 5 minutes discussion. Both students are present at the exam and will also participate in the discussion.
