# BIO255-Cancer-Epigenetics: Marra lab practical

Here is the material for the practical session of [BIO255](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/index.html#/details/2018/003/SM/50712158) in the Marra lab.

In this practical you will learn about:

1. Principle of bisulfite modification of cytosine.
2. How to treat DNA with bisulfite; how to amplify and then clone bisulfite-treated DNA.
3. How to map cytosine methylation on a genomic region after sequencing of cloned DNA.
4. Basics in R and how to annotate genomic regions.

## Schedule for the week is as follows:

|Time     |Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday|
|-------------|---|---|---|---|
|9:00 - ?     || > Lab session: ??|All day: Report preparation and bioinfo exercise| Lab session: ??|
| ?           || Lab session: ??||Lab session: ??|
|12:00 - 13:00|| Lunch break?   ||Lab session: ??|
|13:01 - 14:30|Bioinfo session 1: R basics|Lab session: ?? ||Lab session: ??|
|14:31 - 15:00|Coffee break|Lab session: ?? ||Lab session: ??|
|15:01 - 16:00|Bioinfo session 2: Genomic Ranges|Lab session: ?? ||Lab session: ??|

* For Tuesday you must bring a laptop with RStudio installed, preferibly with R and all packages up to date (ggplot2, GenomicRanges, annotatr).
* You should spend Thursday solving the exercise from Tuesday, and preparing a report due next week. The report should include a description of the week activities along with results. It should also include the findings from the bioinfo exercise (DMR annotation), and a description of the gene evaluated. Why/how do you think hypermethylation in this gene promotes tumorigensis? feel free to search the web for references to support your arguments. 

The report can be structured with: Small introduction, aims, methods, results, discussion, maximum 3 pages.
