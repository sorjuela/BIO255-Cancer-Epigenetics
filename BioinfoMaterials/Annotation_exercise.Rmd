```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Use similar code from `AnnotationandGRanges_demo.Rmd` and annotate the DMR to be analyzed during the lab practical. Plotting the region is OPTIONAL.

```{r eval = F}

chr <- "chr7"
start <- 37956000
end <- start + 100
```

* How many different CpG-related annotations does this region annotate to?
* How many different genes does this region annotate to?
* What different sections (type) of this gene does the region belong to?
* Why does the `hg19_genes_1to5kb` annotation type appear more than once?
* What will happen if your region is bigger? smaller?

If you have questions and I'm not around, send an email to `orjuela@imcr.uzh.ch`. Send your answers to the same email in an `.Rmd` file.  

OPTIONAL: Submit a pull request to the `sorjuela/BIO255-Cancer-Epigenetics` repository with your answers.
